Project 1 - html, css and JS

!!!!!! I used Visual Studio Code Live Server to make this work as I have used localStorage, fetch() and import/export so please use Live Server or any similar software that can run the pages on the SAME DOMAIN !!!!!!


All products information and images were taken from amazon.com

This project is based on E-commerce site where you can browse products (only 15 products) and check their informations and place orders

I have done tests to make this work on both PCs and mobile phones (I mainly used an iPhone 16)

Friday 13th and Saturday 14th, I focused on most of the html and css.

Monday 16th and Tuesday 17th, I focused on JS and css.

Thursday 19th, I focused on splitting the 1 script file into multiple script file to fix many issues I had for example allowing some page to have a custom DOMContentLoaded event listener.

Friday 20th, I tried learning some VERY BASIC animations like fading in or moving an element to a position (I achieved these with clearInterval and setInterval alongside a function frame which will have an if/else deciding what to do every frame)

Monday 22th, I only added more products till I hit 15 products. (do note products are loaded dynamically so only 1 html file)

There is an easter egg if you hover on the very bottom in the center of the about us screen. (a small basic text rpg game)
